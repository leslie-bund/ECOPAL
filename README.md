## PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This web application aims to bridge the gap between customers(HouseHold, Companies etc.) and 
Waste Management Board e.g Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA). It is common knowledge that disposing waste can be a herculean task, 
hence the illicit littering and disposal of waste, which can also be as a result of irregular pickups by truck drivers.
 The application stands to:

    1.Provide logistics on waste disposal thus easing the burden on customers as regards disposing waste.

    2.Provide a functional platform for scheduling pickups. 

    3.Provide Admins e.g LAWMA a track record of drivers, pending orders etc. thus mitigating irregular pickups.
